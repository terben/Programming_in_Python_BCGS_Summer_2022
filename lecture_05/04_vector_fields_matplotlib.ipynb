    "- Please do not get confused that plots are created via `fig, ax = ...` and `ax.`-calls instead with the `plt.`-variants. The `fig, ax..` method is more flexible and we come back to it later in class. We need it here to create plots with equal scaling in `x` and `y`.\n",

With our point-source, it is difficult to obtain a `nice-looking` plot but please play around with it anyways. `plt.streamplot` shows the *flow* of the field (negelcting the field-strength) and is better suited for our example.\n",
